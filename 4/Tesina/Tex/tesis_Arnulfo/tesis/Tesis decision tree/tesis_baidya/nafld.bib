@article{Romero-Ibarguengoitia:2017aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of predicting nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obesity by retinal vascular changes (RVC) found in fundoscopy and to determine whether this is related to a low-grade inflammatory process.
METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional analysis that included 152 (ages 18-45 years) patients divided into four groups: NAFLD and BMI less than 25, absence of NAFLD and BMI less than 25, NAFLD and BMI more than 30, and absence of NAFLD and BMI more than 30. Retinal fundoscopy, hepatic ultrasound, metabolic profile, and cytokine measurement were performed. We calculated odds ratio [95% confidence interval (CI)], performed diagnostic utility tests, and carried out a 2 factorial analysis.
RESULTS: Obesity was associated with RVC (odds ratio: 21.25; 95% CI: 8.79-51.4) and NAFLD [25 (9.07-72.6)]. NAFLD was associated with RVC [11.24 (4.98-26.48)], and the prediction of NAFLD showed a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 68-82) and a specificity of 81% (75-86); when RVC-obesity were combined, sensitivity increased to 90% (88-91.7), with a specificity of 85% (84-85.8). C-reactive protein was associated with the three factors, suggesting an independent contribution. Thin patients with RVC and NAFLD had higher concentrations of interleukin-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ.
CONCLUSION: NAFLD in patients with obesity without diabetes or hypertension can be predicted by RVC, a noninvasive technique carried out by eye fundoscopy. NAFLD alone can drive inflammatory conditions in the absence of obesity that manifests as RVC.},

@article{Younossi:2008aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), only patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) show convincing evidence for progression. To date, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of NASH; however, liver biopsy is expensive and associated with a small risk, emphasizing the urgent need for noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers. Recent findings suggest a role for apoptosis and adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of NASH. The aim of this study was to develop a noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for NASH.
METHODS: The study included 101 patients with liver biopsies who were tested with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based assays. Of these, 69 were included in the biomarker development set and 32 were included in the biomarker validation set. Clinical data and serum samples were collected at the time of biopsy. Fasting serum samples were assayed for adiponectin, resistin, insulin, glucose, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, cytokeratin CK-18 (M65 antigen), and caspase-cleaved CK-18 (M30 antigen).
RESULTS: Data analysis revealed that the levels of M30 antigen (cleaved CK-18) predicted histological NASH with 70% sensitivity and 83.7% specificity and area under the curve (AUC) = 0.711, p < 10(-4), whereas the predictive value of the levels of intact CK-18 (M65) was higher (63.6% sensitivity and 89.4% specificity and AUC = 0.814, p < 10(-4)). Histological NASH could be predicted by a combination of Cleaved CK-18, a product of the subtraction of Cleaved CK-18 level from intact CK-18 level, serum adiponectin, and serum resistin with a sensitivity of 95.45% sensitivity, specificity of 70.21%, and AUC of 0.908 (p < 10(-4)). Blinded validation of this model confirmed its reliability for separating NASH from simple steatosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Four ELISA-based tests were combined to form a simple diagnostic biomarker for NASH.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biopsy is the usual gold standard for liver steatosis assessment. The aim of this study was to identify a panel of biomarkers (SteatoTest), with sufficient predictive values, for the non-invasive diagnosis of steatosis in patients with or without chronic liver disease. Biomarkers and panels were assessed in a training group of consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C and B, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and were validated in two independent groups including a prospective one. Steatosis was blindly assessed by using a previously validated scoring system.
RESULTS: 310 patients were included in the training group; 434 in three validation groups; and 140 in a control group. SteatoTest was constructed using a combination of the 6 components of FibroTest-ActiTest plus body mass index, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose adjusted for age and gender. SteatoTest area under the ROC curves was 0.79 (SE = 0.03) in the training group; 0.80 (0.04) in validation group 1; 0.86 (0.03) in validation group 2; and 0.72 (0.05) in the validation group 3 - all significantly higher than the standard markers: gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase or alanine aminotransferase. The median SteatoTest value was 0.13 in fasting controls; 0.16 in non-fasting controls; 0.31 in patients without steatosis; 0.39 in grade 1 steatosis (0-5%); 0.58 in grade 2 (6-32%); and 0.74 in grade 3-4 (33-100%). For the diagnosis of grade 2-4 steatosis, the sensitivity of SteatoTest at the 0.30 cut-off was 0.91, 0.98, 1.00 and 0.85 and the specificity at the 0.70 cut-off was 0.89, 0.83, 0.92, 1.00, for the training and three validation groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: SteatoTest is a simple and non-invasive quantitative estimate of liver steatosis and may reduce the need for liver biopsy, particularly in patients with metabolic risk factor.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for assessing histologic lesions of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim was to develop and validate a new biomarker of non alcoholic steato hepatitis (NASH) the NashTest (NT) in patients with NAFLD.
METHODS: 160 patients with NAFLD were prospectively included in a training group, 97 were included in a multicenter validation group and 383 controls. Histological diagnoses used Kleiner et al's scoring system, with 3 classes for NASH: "Not NASH", "Borderline", "NASH"). The area under the ROC curves (AUROC), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were assessed.
RESULTS: NT was developed using patented algorithms combining 13 parameters: age, sex, height, weight, and serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, alpha2macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase, transaminases ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. AUROCs of NT for the diagnosis of NASH in the training and validation groups were, respectively, 0.79 (95%C I 0.69-0.86) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.67-0.87; P = 0.94); for the diagnosis of borderline NASH they were: 0.69 (95% CI 0.60-0.77) and 0.69 (95% CI 0.57-0.78; P = 0.98) and for the diagnosis of no NASH, 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.84) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.67-0.90; P = 0.34). When the two groups were pooled together the NashTest Sp for NASH = 94% (PPV = 66%), and Se = 33% (NPV = 81%); for borderline NASH or NASH Sp = 50% (PPV = 74%) and Se = 88% (NPV = 72%).
CONCLUSION: In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NashTest, a simple and non-invasive biomarker reliably predicts the presence or absence of NASH.},

	Abstract = {The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to be 25-30% of the population, and is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes in Korea. NAFLD is a "hot potato" for pharmaceutical companies. Many clinical trials are underway to develop a first-in-class drug to treat NAFLD. However, there are several challenging issues regarding the diagnosis of NAFLD. Currently, liver biopsy is the gold standard method for the diagnosis of NAFLD and steatohepatitis. Ideally, globally recognized standards for histological diagnosis and methods to optimize observer agreement on biopsy interpretation should be developed. Liver biopsy is the best method rather than a perfect one. Recently, multi-parametric magnetic resonance imagery can estimate the amount of intrahepatic fat successfully and is widely used in clinical trials. But no diagnostic method can discriminate between steatohepatitis and simple steatosis. The other unresolved issue in regard to NAFLD is the absence of satisfactory treatment options. Vitamin E and obeticholic acid have shown protective effects in randomized controlled trials, but this drug has not been approved for use in Korea. This study will provide a description of diagnostic methods and treatments that are currently recommended for NAFLD.},

These patients were identified in a survey performed between February 1990 and October 1992 (The Mexico City Diabetes Study). We located 214 (75.35%) of the original 284 patients and invited them to attend a clinic where they were interviewed and had a complete ophthalmologic examination. All participants had, in addition to the retinal examination by a certified ophthalmologist, seven fields stereo fundus photographs taken with a Topcon 50X retinal camera. Photos were taken using ASA 100 Kodak film and processed in their laboratory. All photographs were read and graded for quality and level of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the Reading Center of the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Wisconsin. A total of 37 (43.5%) men and 69 (53.5%) women had no evidence of DR. In 16 (18.8%) men and 21 (16.3%) women there was background DR. In 25 (29.4%) men and 30 (23.3%) women there was preproliferative DR. In 5 (5.9%) men and in 7 (5.4%) women there was proliferative DR. Macular edema was diagnosed in 7 (8.2%) men and 6 (4.7%) women, of these in 3 (3.5%) men and in 5 (3.9%) women the macular edema was central. This complication is associated with duration of diabetes, chronic poor metabolic control and microalbuminuria. A very significant proportion of cases with sight threatening DR remains undiagnosed and untreated. Consequently there is a significant number of cases developing into blindness that could have been prevented.},

	Abstract = {Diabetic macular changes in the form of yellowish spots and extravasations that permeated part or the whole thickness of the retina were observed for the first time by Eduard Jaeger in 1856. This was only possible as a result of the newly developed direct ophthalmoscope that was first described in 1855. Jaeger's findings were controversial at the time and Albrecht von Graefe openly claimed that there was no proof of a causal relationship between diabetes and retinal complications. It was only in 1872 that Edward Nettleship published his seminal paper "On oedema or cystic disease of the retina" providing the first histopathological proof of "cystoid degeneration of the macula" in patients with diabetes. In 1876, Wilhelm Manz described the proliferative changes occurring in diabetic retinopathy and the importance of tractional retinal detachments and vitreous haemorrhages. In the early years of the 20th century, the debate continued whether macular changes were directly related to diabetes or whether they were due to hypertension and arteriosclerosis. It was not until the second half of the century that the work of Arthur James Ballantyne in Glasgow provided more evidence that suggested that diabetic retinopathy represents a unique vasculopathy.},

	Abstract = {Due to the worldwide epidemic of obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes. NAFLD represents a spectrum of liver injury ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which may progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Individuals with NAFLD, especially those with metabolic syndrome, have higher overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and liver-related mortality compared with the general population. According to the population-based studies, NAFLD and NASH are more prevalent in males and in Hispanics. Both the gender and racial ethnic differences in NAFLD and NASH are likely attributed to interaction between environmental, behavioral, and genetic factors. Using genome-wide association studies, several genetic variants have been identified to be associated with NAFLD/NASH. However, these variants account for only a small amount of variation in hepatic steatosis among ethnic groups and may serve as modifiers of the natural history of NAFLD. Alternatively, these variants may not be the causative variants but simply markers representing a larger body of genetic variations. In this article, we provide a concise review of the gender and racial differences in the prevalence of NAFLD and NASH in adults. We also discuss the possible mechanisms for these disparities. },

	Abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide that primarily develops in cirrhosis resulting from chronic infection by hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, alcoholic injury, and to a lesser extent from genetically determined disorders such as hemochromatosis. HCC has recently been linked to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of obesity and related metabolic disorders such as diabetes. This association is alarming due to the globally high prevalence of these conditions and may contribute to the rising incidence of HCC witnessed in many industrialized countries. There is also evidence that NAFLD acts synergistically with other risk factors of HCC such as chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic liver injury. Moreover, HCC may complicate non-cirrhotic NAFLD with mild or absent fibrosis, greatly expanding the population potentially at higher risk. Major systemic and liver-specific molecular mechanisms involved include insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, increased TNF signaling pathways, and alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. These provide new targets for prevention, early recognition, and effective treatment of HCC associated with NAFLD. Indeed, both metformin and PPAR gamma agonists have been associated with lower risk and improved prognosis of HCC. This review summarizes current evidence as it pertains to the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and prevention of NAFLD-associated HCC.},

METHODS: A total of 179 people with Type 2 diabetes were included in this study. Liver fat content (assessed using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy), fatty liver index score, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score, and SteatoTest and FibroTest scores were determined.
RESULTS: According to proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, 68.7% of participants had steatosis (liver fat content >5.5%). The application of the guidelines using several combinations (fatty liver index + non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis scores, Steatotest + FibroTest scores, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy + non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy + FibroTest) resulted in a referral to a liver clinic for 33.5-84.9% people with Type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of these new algorithms for the diagnosis, and follow-up of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease would lead to an excessive number of people with Type 2 diabetes being referred to a liver clinic. We suggest that new clinical and/or biological biomarkers of steatosis and fibrosis be specifically validated in people with Type 2 diabetes.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most prevalent chronic diseases among elderly population is the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of MetS and associated factors among Mexican elderly people.
SUBJECTS: Cross-sectional survey carried out in Mexico (2007). A random sample (n=516) of the elderly population (≥65years; 277 female, 239 male) was interviewed. Anthropometric and analytical measurements, and a general questionnaire incorporating questions related to socio-demographic and life-style factors were used. MetS definition AHA/NHLBI/IDF was applied.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS in the elderly (≥65years) was of 72.9% (75.7% men; 70.4% women). Participants with values above MetS cut-off points were 92.4% (hypertension), 77.8% (hypertriglyceridemia), 77.1% (low HDL-cholesterol), 71.1% (hyperglycaemia), and 65.4% (central obesity). People with MetS showed higher values of anthropometric and biochemical variables than those without MetS, except for the height, cholesterol and creatinine. Mid-high education level (9-12 years), no smokers and former smokers, and Central-Western inhabitants of Mexico were associated with MetS components. BMI status was the main determinant of MetS prevalence and MetS components.
CONCLUSION: The reported prevalence of MetS among the elderly Mexican population was higher than those previously obtained in the geographical area, showing a major public health problem in Mexican elders.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate whether the metabolic syndrome (MetS) defined by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, which has abdominal adiposity as a mandatory element, predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality better than the cluster of other IDF-defined abnormalities not including abdominal adiposity.
METHODS: Data from nine European population-based studies, including 7782 men and 7739 women (aged 30-89 years), with a median follow-up of 8.55 years, were jointly analyzed. Hazard ratios for CVD mortality were calculated with Cox regression models.
RESULTS: In total, 41% of the men and 38% of the women had the IDF MetS. Individuals with the IDF MetS were by definition more obese and had a higher prevalence of diabetes than non-obese subjects with > or = 2 IDF abnormalities; whereas non-obese men with > or = 3 factors had more atherogenic lipid profiles. Multivariate adjusted hazard ratio for CVD death in men and women with the IDF MetS was 2.44 (1.69-2.98) and 2.32 (1.27-4.23); in non-obese men with 2 and > or = 3 factors the hazard ratio was 1.60 (1.12-2.30) and 2.44 (1.62-3.66), respectively, and in non-obese women with 2 factors the hazard ratio was 2.41 (1.09-5.33).
CONCLUSIONS: The cluster of the CVD risk factors predicted CVD mortality regardless of the presence or absence of the abdominal adiposity. Inclusion of abdominal adiposity as a prerequisite will miss those non-obese individuals who have increased CVD mortality.},

@article{Adams:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Inefficient muscle long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) combustion is associated with insulin resistance, but molecular links between mitochondrial fat catabolism and insulin action remain controversial. We hypothesized that plasma acylcarnitine profiling would identify distinct metabolite patterns reflective of muscle fat catabolism when comparing individuals bearing a missense G304A uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3 g/a) polymorphism to controls, because UCP3 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and g/a individuals have reduced whole-body fat oxidation. MS analyses of 42 carnitine moieties in plasma samples from fasting type 2 diabetics (n = 44) and nondiabetics (n = 12) with or without the UCP3 g/a polymorphism (n = 28/genotype: 22 diabetic, 6 nondiabetic/genotype) were conducted. Contrary to our hypothesis, genotype had a negligible impact on plasma metabolite patterns. However, a comparison of nondiabetics vs. type 2 diabetics revealed a striking increase in the concentrations of fatty acylcarnitines reflective of incomplete LCFA beta-oxidation in the latter (i.e. summed C10- to C14-carnitine concentrations were approximately 300% of controls; P = 0.004). Across all volunteers (n = 56), acetylcarnitine rose and propionylcarnitine decreased with increasing hemoglobin A1c (r = 0.544, P < 0.0001; and r = -0.308, P < 0.05, respectively) and with increasing total plasma acylcarnitine concentration. In proof-of-concept studies, we made the novel observation that C12-C14 acylcarnitines significantly stimulated nuclear factor kappa-B activity (up to 200% of controls) in RAW264.7 cells. These results are consistent with the working hypothesis that inefficient tissue LCFA beta-oxidation, due in part to a relatively low tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity, increases tissue accumulation of acetyl-CoA and generates chain-shortened acylcarnitine molecules that activate proinflammatory pathways implicated in insulin resistance.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence, distribution and degree of control of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Mexican population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subjects were classified as previously diagnosed T2D (PD); or as "finding of the survey" (FS) (glucose >or=126 mg/dL). Hemoglobin A1c was measured in PD-subjects.
RESULTS: The prevalence for PD-T2D was 7.34% (95%CI 6.3, 8.5) and for FS 7.07% (95%CI 6.1, 8.1), summing 14.42%; (7.3 million diabetics). 5.3% of PD-T2D were in good, 38.4% in poor and 56.2% very poor control. Older age (OR=0.96, 95%CI 0.94, 0.97), lower BMI (OR=0.95, 95%CI 0.91, 1.0), were protective for poor control. Affiliation to private services (OR=1.77, 95%CI 0.98, 3.13), larger T2D duration (OR=1.05, 95%CI 1.01, 1.08), and combining oral medication and insulin (OR=16.1, 95%CI 1.61, 161) were riskier.
CONCLUSIONS: We found an alarming prevalence of T2D in Mexican population; the majority of PD diabetics are in poor control. Research on the latter is warranted.},

Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.},

	Abstract = {Emerging technologies allow the high-throughput profiling of metabolic status from a blood specimen (metabolomics). We investigated whether metabolite profiles could predict the development of diabetes. Among 2,422 normoglycemic individuals followed for 12 years, 201 developed diabetes. Amino acids, amines and other polar metabolites were profiled in baseline specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Cases and controls were matched for age, body mass index and fasting glucose. Five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids had highly significant associations with future diabetes: isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine. A combination of three amino acids predicted future diabetes (with a more than fivefold higher risk for individuals in top quartile). The results were replicated in an independent, prospective cohort. These findings underscore the potential key role of amino acid metabolism early in the pathogenesis of diabetes and suggest that amino acid profiles could aid in diabetes risk assessment.},

The three BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine and valine are known to mediate activation of several important hepatic metabolic signaling pathways ranging from insulin signaling to glucose regulation. The purpose of this study is to profile changes in hepatic BCAA metabolite levels with transcriptomic changes in the progression of human NAFLD to discover novel mechanisms of disease progression. Metabolomic and transcriptomic data sets representing the spectrum of human NAFLD (normal, steatosis, NASH fatty, and NASH not fatty livers) were utilized for this study. During the transition from steatosis to NASH, increases in the levels of leucine (127% of normal), isoleucine (139%), and valine (147%) were observed. Carnitine metabolites also exhibited significantly elevated profiles in NASH fatty and NASH not fatty samples and included propionyl, hexanoyl, lauryl, acetyl and butyryl carnitine. Amino acid and BCAA metabolism gene sets were significantly enriched among downregulated genes during NASH. These cumulative alterations in BCAA metabolite and amino acid metabolism gene profiles represent adaptive physiological responses to disease-induced hepatic stress in NASH patients.},

	Abstract = {Seven normal glucose-tolerant obese subjects [ideal body weight (IBW) = 161%] and 18 controls (IBW = 102%) were studied with the euglycemic insulin clamp (10 and 40 mU.m-2.min-1) technique, [14C]leucine infusion, and indirect calorimetry to examine if the insulin resistance with respect to glucose metabolism extends to amino acid/protein metabolism. In the basal state, total plasma amino acid and leucine concentrations, endogenous leucine flux (ELF), leucine oxidation (LO), and nonoxidative leucine disposal (NOLD) were similar in obese and control subjects. During both low (10 mU.m-2.min-1)- and higher (40 mU.m-2.min-1)-dose insulin clamp studies, insulin-mediated glucose uptake was reduced in obese vs. control subjects (P < 0.01). During the last hour of the higher-dose insulin clamp step, the decrease in total plasma amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, and leucine concentration was impaired in obese vs. control subjects (P < 0.01). However, suppression of ELF and NOLD was similar in both groups. During the low-dose insulin clamp, the decrease in plasma leucine concentration, LO, and ELF all were impaired (P < 0.01). A second study was performed in which the total plasma amino acid concentration was increased two- to threefold in both groups. Under these conditions of low plasma insulin/high amino acid levels, LO and NOLD increased similarly in obese and control subjects. In conclusion, insulin resistance is a common feature of both glucose and protein metabolism in obesity. The defect in protein metabolism is characterized by an impairment of the ability of insulin to inhibit proteolysis; the stimulatory effect of hyperaminoacidemia on protein synthesis is intact in obesity.},

However, the effects of dietary histidine on general population are not known. The objective of this Internet-based cross-sectional study was to evaluate the associations between dietary histidine and prevalence of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity in northern Chinese population. A total of 2376 participants were randomly recruited and asked to finish our Internet-based dietary questionnaire for the Chinese (IDQC). Afterwards, 88 overweight/obese participants were randomly selected to explore the possible mechanism. Compared with healthy controls, dietary histidine was significantly lower in overweight (p < 0.05) and obese (p < 0.01) participants of both sexes. Dietary histidine was inversely associated with body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and blood pressure in overall population and stronger associations were observed in women and overweight/obese participants. Higher dietary histidine was associated with lower prevalence of overweight/obesity and abdominal obesity, especially in women. Further studies indicated that higher dietary histidine was associated with lower fasting blood glucose (FBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 2-h postprandial glucose (2 h-PG), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), malonaldehyde (MDA) and vaspin and higher glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and adiponectin of overweight/obese individuals of both sexes. In conclusion, higher dietary histidine is inversely associated with energy intake, status of insulin resistance, inflammation and oxidative stress in overweight/obese participants and lower prevalence of overweight/obesity in northern Chinese adults.},

	Abstract = {To examine whether moderate obesity and differences in body fat distribution are associated with abnormalities of protein metabolism, leucine turnover was measured in three groups of age-matched premenopausal women. Ten upper-body-obese (UB Ob), 10 lower-body-obese (LB Ob), and 10 nonobese (Non Ob) women were studied in an overnight postabsorptive condition (basal) and again during an infusion of low physiologic amounts of insulin (insulin clamp). Results showed that basal leucine carbon flux was greater (P less than 0.05) in UB Ob and LB Ob women than in Non Ob women (2.96 +/- 0.08 vs 3.14 +/- 0.16 vs 2.68 +/- 0.08 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1, respectively; mean +/- SEM). Leucine carbon flux was not suppressed during the insulin-clamp study in UB Ob women but was in the LB Ob and Non Ob women. We conclude that moderate obesity is associated with increased proteolysis and that insulin's antiproteolytic actions are impaired in upper-body obesity. These findings could have implications for future studies of and treatment of obesity.},

To test its impact on metabolic homeostasis, we fed rats on high-fat (HF), HF with supplemented BCAA (HF/BCAA), or standard chow (SC) diets. Despite having reduced food intake and a low rate of weight gain equivalent to the SC group, HF/BCAA rats were as insulin resistant as HF rats. Pair-feeding of HF diet to match the HF/BCAA animals or BCAA addition to SC diet did not cause insulin resistance. Insulin resistance induced by HF/BCAA feeding was accompanied by chronic phosphorylation of mTOR, JNK, and IRS1Ser307 and by accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines in muscle, and it was reversed by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Our findings show that in the context of a dietary pattern that includes high fat consumption, BCAA contributes to development of obesity-associated insulin resistance.},

	Abstract = {Obesity is associated with multiple adverse health effects and a high risk of developing metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, there is a great need to identify circulating parameters that link changes in body fat mass with obesity. This study combines proteomic and metabolomic approaches to identify circulating molecules that discriminate healthy lean from healthy obese individuals in an exploratory study design. To correct for variations in physical activity, study participants performed a one hour exercise bout to exhaustion. Subsequently, circulating factors differing between lean and obese individuals, independent of physical activity, were identified. The DIGE approach yielded 126 differentially abundant spots representing 39 unique proteins. Differential abundance of proteins was confirmed by ELISA for antithrombin-III, clusterin, complement C3 and complement C3b, pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), serum amyloid P (SAP), and vitamin-D binding protein (VDBP). Targeted serum metabolomics of 163 metabolites identified 12 metabolites significantly related to obesity. Among those, glycine (GLY), glutamine (GLN), and glycero-phosphatidylcholine 42:0 (PCaa 42:0) serum concentrations were higher, whereas PCaa 32:0, PCaa 32:1, and PCaa 40:5 were decreased in obese compared to lean individuals. The integrated bioinformatic evaluation of proteome and metabolome data yielded an improved group separation score of 2.65 in contrast to 2.02 and 2.16 for the single-type use of proteomic or metabolomics data, respectively. The identified circulating parameters were further investigated in an extended set of 30 volunteers and in the context of two intervention studies. Those included 14 obese patients who had undergone sleeve gastrectomy and 12 patients on a hypocaloric diet. For determining the long-term adaptation process the samples were taken six months after the treatment. In multivariate regression analyses, SAP, CLU, RBP4, PEDF, GLN, and C18:2 showed the strongest correlation to changes in body fat mass. The combined serum proteomic and metabolomic profiling reveals a link between the complement system and obesity and identifies both novel (C3b, CLU, VDBP, and all metabolites) and confirms previously discovered markers (PEDF, RBP4, C3, ATIII, and SAP) of body fat mass changes.},

	Abstract = {Liver and serum metabolites of obese and lean mice fed on high fat or normal diets were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Obese and lean groups were clearly discriminated from each other on PLS-DA score plot and major metabolites contributing to the discrimination were assigned as lipid metabolites (fatty acids, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs)), lipid metabolism intermediates (betaine, carnitine, and acylcarnitines), amino acids, acidic compounds, monosaccharides, and serotonin. A high-fat diet increased lipid metabolites but decreased lipid metabolism intermediates and the NAD/NADH ratio, indicating that abnormal lipid and energy metabolism induced by a high-fat diet resulted in fat accumulation via decreased β-oxidation. In addition, this study revealed that the levels of many metabolites, including serotonin, betaine, pipecolic acid, and uric acid, were positively or negatively related to obesity-associated diseases. On the basis of these metabolites, we proposed a metabolic pathway related to high-fat diet-induced obesity. These metabolites can be used to better understand obesity and related diseases induced by a hyperlipidic diet. Furthermore, the level changes of these metabolites can be used to assess the risk of obesity and the therapeutic effect of obesity management.},

	Abstract = {The plasma profile of subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), steatosis, and steatohepatitis (NASH) was examined using an untargeted global metabolomic analysis to identify specific disease-related patterns and to identify potential noninvasive biomarkers. Plasma samples were obtained after an overnight fast from histologically confirmed nondiabetic subjects with hepatic steatosis (n = 11) or NASH (n = 24) and were compared with healthy, age- and sex-matched controls (n = 25). Subjects with NAFLD were obese, were insulin resistant, and had higher plasma concentrations of homocysteine and total cysteine and lower plasma concentrations of total glutathione. Metabolomic analysis showed markedly higher levels of glycocholate, taurocholate, and glycochenodeoxycholate in subjects with NAFLD. Plasma concentrations of long-chain fatty acids were lower and concentrations of free carnitine, butyrylcarnitine, and methylbutyrylcarnitine were higher in NASH. Several glutamyl dipeptides were higher whereas cysteine-glutathione levels were lower in NASH and steatosis. Other changes included higher branched-chain amino acids, phosphocholine, carbohydrates (glucose, mannose), lactate, pyruvate, and several unknown metabolites. Random forest analysis and recursive partitioning of the metabolomic data could separate healthy subjects from NAFLD with an error rate of approximately 8% and separate NASH from healthy controls with an error rate of 4%. Hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis could not be separated using the metabolomic profile. Plasma metabolomic analysis revealed marked changes in bile salts and in biochemicals related to glutathione in subjects with NAFLD. Statistical analysis identified a panel of biomarkers that could effectively separate healthy controls from NAFLD and healthy controls from NASH. These biomarkers can potentially be used to follow response to therapeutic interventions.},

@article{Jung2014Obesity-and-its,
	Abstract = {Accumulating evidence indicates that obesity is closely associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Obesity results from an imbalance between food intake and energy expenditure, which leads to an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is now recognized not only as a main site of storage of excess energy derived from food intake but also as an endocrine organ. The expansion of adipose tissue produces a number of bioactive substances, known as adipocytokines or adipokines, which trigger chronic low-grade inflammation and interact with a range of processes in many different organs. Although the precise mechanisms are still unclear, dysregulated production or secretion of these adipokines caused by excess adipose tissue and adipose tissue dysfunction can contribute to the development of obesity-related metabolic diseases. In this review, we focus on the role of several adipokines associated with obesity and the potential impact on obesity-related metabolic diseases. Multiple lines evidence provides valuable insights into the roles of adipokines in the development of obesity and its metabolic complications. Further research is still required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the metabolic actions of a few newly identified adipokines.},

	Abstract = {A significant body of evidence now forces us to rethink the causes of NASH. Once thought to be a disease caused by triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes with subsequent oxidant stress and lipid peroxidation causing inflammation and fibrosis, new data from animal studies and a limited number of human studies now provide convincing evidence that triglyceride accumulation does not cause insulin resistance or cellular injury in the liver. The lipotoxic liver injury hypothesis for the pathogenesis of NASH suggests that we need to focus our therapeutic efforts on reducing the burden of fatty acids going to the liver or being synthesized in the liver. This can be accomplished by improving insulin sensitivity at the level of adipose tissue to prevent inappropriate peripheral lipolysis and by preventing unnecessary de novo lipogenesis in the liver. Excess carbohydrates are the major substrates for de novo lipogenesis, and thus, reducing carbohydrate consumption through dietary changes and increasing muscle glucose uptake through exercise remain important cornerstones of treatment and prevention of lipotoxic liver injury, a disease hitherto called NASH.},

	Abstract = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, and is strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome. In the last decade, it has become apparent that the clinical burden of NAFLD is not restricted to liver-related morbidity or mortality, and the majority of deaths in NAFLD patients are related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. These findings have fuelled concerns that NAFLD may be a new, and added risk factor for extrahepatic diseases such as CVD, chronic kidney disease (CKD), colorectal cancer, endocrinopathies (including type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM] and thyroid dysfunction), and osteoporosis. In this review we critically appraise key studies on NAFLD-associated extrahepatic disease. There was marked heterogeneity between studies in study design (cross-sectional versus prospective; sample size; presence/absence of well-defined controls), population (ethnic diversity; community-based versus hospital-based cohorts), and method of NAFLD diagnosis (liver enzymes versus imaging versus biopsy). Taking this into account, the cumulative evidence to date suggests that individuals with NAFLD (specifically, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) harbor an increased and independent risk of developing CVD, T2DM, CKD, and colorectal neoplasms. We propose future studies are necessary to better understand these risks, and suggest an example of a screening strategy.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ranges from fatty liver alone to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Most previous studies have short follow-up and have not carefully delineated different histological types when determining clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with different types of nonalcoholic fatty liver.
METHODS: All liver biopsy specimens from 1979 to 1987 with fat accumulation were assessed for inflammation, ballooning degeneration, Mallory hyaline, and fibrosis. Biopsy specimens were also assessed for histological iron and hepatitis C RNA. Outcomes were cirrhosis, mortality, and liver-related mortality.
RESULTS: Of 772 liver biopsy specimens, complete data were available in 132 patients. Fatty liver (type 1) did not differ from the other three types combined with respect to gender, race, age, or obesity. Cirrhosis was more common in the other types combined (22%) than fatty liver alone (4%; P </= 0.001). Overall mortality, histological iron, and hepatitis C did not differ between groups. Most of the liver-related deaths were in type 4.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of cirrhosis and liver-related death is not uniform across the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver. These poor outcomes are more frequent in patients in whom biopsies show ballooning degeneration and Mallory hyaline or fibrosis.},

	Abstract = {Steatohepatitis (fatty liver hepatitis), histologically identical to alcoholic disease, occurs in some obese patients after jejunoileal bypass. A similar lesion occurs rarely in obese patients without bypass surgery, but the risk factors are poorly understood. Hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis were sought in 351 apparently nonalcoholic patients at autopsy and various risk factors were evaluated. Incidence of steatosis and steatohepatitis correlated with the degree of obesity. Steatohepatitis was found in 18.5% of markedly obese patients and 2.7% of lean patients. Additional risk factors for steatohepatitis were type II diabetes, weight loss in the preterminal period shortly before death and intravenous glucose therapy in the last week of life. Severe fibrosis was found in 13.8% of markedly obese patients and in 6.6% of lean patients; this difference was largely explained by the higher prevalence of diabetes in obese groups. The risk factors defined in this study are known to be associated with abnormalities of free fatty acid metabolism. Obesity, type II diabetes and intravenous glucose therapy are associated with hyperinsulinemia, which may inhibit fatty acid oxidation. Obesity and weight loss increase the presentation of fatty acids to the liver. Similar metabolic changes may occur in obese patients after jejunoileal bypass surgery. Thus this study supports the hypothesis that fatty acids have a role in the hepatocellular necrosis found in some obese individuals.},
